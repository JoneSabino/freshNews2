### Improvements

If I had more time and if it was a production bot, I would work on these items:

1. **Modularize Code**: Break the scraper class into multiple files for better readability and maintainability.
2. **Enhanced Logging**: Implement more detailed and structured logging for easier debugging and monitoring.
3. **Retries**: Add retry mechanisms to handle transient failures and improve reliability.
4. **Distributed Robots**: Split the process into multiple Robocloud robots to handle larger volumes of data more efficiently using work items. 
5. **Improved Error Handling**: Enhance error and exception handling to ensure graceful recovery and meaningful error messages.
